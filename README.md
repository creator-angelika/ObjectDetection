This project utilizes Python and AI technology to precisely identify and categorize different objects effortlessly.
By leveraging the Caffe model and OpenCV library, the project distinguishes various objects, including vehicles.
The object detection feature enriches AR and VR experiences by recognizing real-world objects, empowering users to interact with virtual elements such as placing furniture or using tools in simulated environments.
